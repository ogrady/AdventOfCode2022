These are my solutions (and my inputs) to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) ðŸŽ„

I did them all in pure Node.js.

As I was sharing and discussing my solutions in a Discord server, I tried to golf them into the message limit of 2000 characters. This sometimes severely hurt readability, I'm afraid.

# Day 11
Many stumbled over part 2 on this one, including me. The trick is to keep the intermediate `worryLevel` small, which we can do by regularily applying `% n` to it (we can actually do this whenever we want, but have to do it before the `worryLevel` overflows our number range).
`n` has to be selected in a way that dividing by it does not affect divisibility of future divisors. We can calculate `n` ahead as we know what numbers we will divide the `worryLevel` by (as we know the numbers `x` each Monkey tries to divide the `worryLevel` by). We can simply use the _least common multiple_ of these `x`s. As they are conveniently all prime numbers, we can just multiply them with each other to find our `n`.

# Day 12
I hated solving this task with passion. Which is actually on me, as I had to chase a bug in my grid initialisation for half a day. From then on it's just Dijkstra.
Dijkstra is a "one to all" pathfinding algorithm, meaning that it will find the path for one particular starting position to all other positions in the grid.
We can use this property for part 2. Instead of searching the path from each `a` to `E`, we instead start at `E`. We then know the shortest path to each `a` (and all other positions).
I had to use another trick on top: the paths in this graph are directed. Meaning the costs to move from `x` to `y` are different from the costs for moving from `y` to `x`. As my `cost` function subtracts the ASCII code of the characters I want to check the travel cost for, I have to make sure they are not negative when I reverse the direction, as all costs have to be positive for the Dijkstra algorithm to work.
So I not only had to reverse the direction I was searching into, but also "flip" all characters, so that `a` would become `z`, `b` would by `y` (and the other way around), and so on.
